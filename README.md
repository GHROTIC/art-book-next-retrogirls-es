### **<p align=center>-= Notes =-</p>**

* Supports 4:3 and 16:9 screen ratios. Text may be a little off on others as it's been estimated and untested.
* Original Art removed to reduce bloat and new default images added for resolutions up to 1080p(Some art is poor quality at 1080p and will eventually be replaced).
* Some systems still have placeholder images and will be gradually replaced.
* Extremely old and/or obscure systems may have a random character playing a Video Game due to the difficulty in finding art that represents it.

#### Media Scraping:

* To make game artwork look as good as possible, the recommneded settings for the built-in scraper in Knulli are:
    * Image Source = `Screenshot`
    * Box Source = `Box 2D`
    * Logo Source = `Marquee`
      
* Recommneded Scraper Settings for the built-in Scraper in PlumOS are:
    * Image Source = `Screenshot`

## Theme Configuration

The following options can be changed directly from the main menu under `User Interface Settings > Theme Configuration`

| Setting | Description | Options |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Distribution | Used to define which folder to look in for Theme Customization files. | `Batocera/Knulli`, `RetroBat` |
| Aspect Ratio | Enables you to select the correct aspect ratio for your screen.  This will automatically set itself so you should not need to change it but if the theme layout looks odd or spacing looks incorrect you can use this setting to make sure the aspect ratio matches your screen. | `16:9`, `16:10`, `4:3`, `3:2`, `1:1` |
| System Artwork | Defines the set of artwork that is displayed on the system view | `Default`, `Custom`, `Custom (Fullscreen)` |
| System Logos | Defines the logo set used on all views | `Default`, `Custom` |
| Game Artwork | Defines the type of artwork used to represent a game. These are sourced from the the selections you make in the scraper menu. Image will display the image you selected to scrape for `Image Source`.  Image (Cropped) will display that same image zoomed in to fill the screen.  Boxart will display the image you selected to scrape for `Box Source` | `Image`, `Image (Cropped)`, `Boxart` |
| Game Metadata | Sets if metadata (e.g. description, release date, etc...) should be displayed for a game | `On`, `Off` |
| Font Size | Set the size for text elements throughout the theme. | `Default`, `Small`, `Large` |
| Color Scheme | Sets the color scheme that is used for the theme.  There is a set of prebuilt color schemes that you can select and an option to supply your custom color scheme (selected by choosing `custom`). You can see details on customizations below under [Theme Customizations](#theme-customizations). | `Default`, `Light`, `Steam OS`, `SNES`, `Famicom`, `DMG`, `OLED`, `Custom` |


### Additional UI Settings 

The following EmulationStation settings can also be changed and will update the look of the theme accordingly:
* `User Interface Settings > Show Clock` - This will allow you to turn the system clock on or off(Not Currently Supported in PlumOS)
* `User Interface Settings > On-Screen Help` - This will turn the display of EmulationStation's button help system on or off (Not Currently Supported in PlumOS)
* `User Interface Settings > Show Battery Status` - This will allow you to change what is displayed for the battery status.


## Theme Customizations

Customization has been removed in the PlumOS version and will eventually be phased out for the Knulli Edition. I consider it best to support the original Art Book Next if you want to customize your own version and this will allow me to modify features without breaking the theme in the process.
